# Mangonada Fan Club 🥭🍹

## Getting Started

You can view this website locally by simply opening up index.html on your web browser. But if you want to be able to see changes as you edit and save, you'll need to have npm and node on your machine, and install the relevant packages with:

```sh
npm install
```

(The only dependency is live-server.)
